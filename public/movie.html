<h1>The Best Movie According to Prashant</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2><hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Love and regret lie at the heart of Christopher Nolan’s movies no matter how complex and demanding they seem in structure and storytelling. True to his style in spirit but deviating from the usual in execution and content, the acclaimed director creates a moving masterpiece on human disillusionment. How a man’s biggest discovery and bravery marked his biggest doom. Oppenheimer may have been a genius, but he wasn’t acquainted with the ways of the world. He spoke his mind, trusted everyone, and paid a price for it.</p>
<h3>BAWAAL</h3>
<p>You know what to expect from a romantic travel movie—postcard-perfect sites, adventure, and the lead pair falling in love on the escapade. Then there’s director Nitesh Tiwari’s Bawaal, which offers all this and much more. To begin with, props to Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (renowned for writing and helming quirky films such as Nil Battey Sannata, Panga, Bareilly Ki Barfi, and more) and for weaving a story on love and war that’s poignant and heartrending yet has light moments and romance without one element overpowering the other. And the movie also teaches some life lessons.

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>For all practical purposes, Barbieland is pristine. Various iterations of Barbies and Kens live their beautiful lives in blissful ignorance of the real world. But when the quintessential Barbie (Margot Robbie) begins to have unusual thoughts, she is directed by another Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to enter the world of humans and address her existential crisis. However, chaos ensues when Ken (Ryan Gosling) tags along with her on this quest.</p>
